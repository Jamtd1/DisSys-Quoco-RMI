Task 2

Added src/main/jav/service/auldfellas folder to auldfellas module
copy pasted in the AFQService class from the quoco-master project
Added the rest code as per the lab notes
Due to the JavaBeans style the AFQService class was set to implement Serializable.
Changed getReference9() on line 110 to getReference() as this was assumed to be a spelling error in the notes as I couldn't find this method anywhere else and the method wouldn't compile
Additionally 9 is the key which holds the open bracket "(" symbol which solidified the idea this was an error.
Pulled the initialisation of the fields in the generateQuotations method out of the method and into the class declaration
Set the fields to private and implemented public getters and public setters fro each of the fields
adjusted the code in generateQuotations to call on these getters and setters instead.
Removed the @Override annotation on the gernerateQuotations class and removed the need to implement QuotaionService
Adjusted the clientInfo calls to call the getters instead of the fields since they were now private
Added a default constructor for the AFQService class
Added the required imports for the code
Created the applications class for the auldfellas module
Pasted in the code as per the lecture notes and added the required imports
Compiled the auldfellas code
ran the code using the spring-boot:run

Adjusted the main class in the pom file to client.Client
Copied the deisplayProfile() and displayQuotation() methods into the class
Adjusted the Clientinfo info calls to call the getters due to the private classes
Similarily changed the quotation calls to getters
Copied in the ClientInfo test data
Added in the main method as per the lecture notes
